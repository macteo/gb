  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  def default_url

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :iphone do
    process :resize_to_limit => [320, 240]
  end

  version :iphone_2x do
    process :resize_to_limit => [640, 480]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
